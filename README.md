# Deep Learning-Based Assessment of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Severity - WebApp

This project provides a web application for assessing the severity of Parkinsonâ€™s disease using deep learning techniques. The model analyzes input data and predicts the severity of the disease.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model Integration**: Uses a trained neural network for Parkinsonâ€™s disease assessment.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive web app for predictions.
- **Flask Backend**: Serves the deep learning model and handles API requests.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across multiple devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras  
- **Deployment**: Flask Server  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prashanth370/Deep-Learning-based-assessment-of-Parkinson-s-disease-severity.git
   cd Deep-Learning-based-assessment-of-Parkinson-s-disease-severity/WebApp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to:

   ```
